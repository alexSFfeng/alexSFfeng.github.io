  <!-- ABOUT ME ----------------------------->
  <h1>About me:</h1>
  <p title="Introduction" id="Intro">
      <h2 class="section"><ins>INTRODUCTION:</ins></h2>
      Hi, I am Alex Feng, a student currently pursing a bachelor degree in
      computer science. Like many other CS students, my current objective is to
      obtain an internship that gives me the experience I need to become a
      professional software engineer. However, it seems like internships are becoming
      harder to get, especially for students will little or no work experience.
      For this reason, I added to my website a list of "project bounty";
      they will be some interesting project ideas that I thought of or requested by
      the public. These side projects aim to solve some kind of inconvenience in
      real life. Meanwhile, they can also be put onto resumes and help fellow CS
      students showcase their abilities and passion.
  </p>

  <p>
      I am interested in developing products that help solves everyday inconveniences.
      One of the main reason I want to pursue a career in computer science is that
      it provides infinite room for creativity and innovation. When it comes to bringing
      an idea to real life, there are so many tools for developers to utilize. It would
      be my career goal to be able to develop softwares that benefit everyone's life.
  </p>

  <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/alexSFfeng" target="_blank"><b>My github page</b></a>
      contains all the side projects I have done. Some of them are high school projects
      and some of them are projects I have worked on in College. Come check them out!
      Feel free to modify them anyway you want!
  </p>

  <p title="Education and Experience" id="Education-and-Experience">
    <h2 class="section"><ins>Education</ins></h2>
    I am currently an undergraduate pursing a computer science bachelor's degree at
    UCSD (Class of 2020). My CS-experience has been great so far. Met different kinds of people that
    work on class projects or side projects. I am able to learn valuable programming
    concepts and techniques both in and out of class. <br><br>

    So far, I've learned <b class="skills">data structures, Java, C, Unix shell scripting, and
    version control</b> in school; I also finished a variety of class projects from
    interactive games to re-implementing classic data structures like linked list
    and hash table. <br><br>

    <h2 class="section"><ins>Experience</ins></h2>
    Summer 2017 I didn't get any internship offer from all the companies I've applied
    to. Looking back, I think it is because of the lack of experience and proactivity
    in improving myself. So I decided to find out what kind of projects I want to do
    and start coding right away. Stickie+ (project gallery below) is my very first
    personal project. I spent time that I could be playing games into understanding and
    applying Java's swing api and learning how to save states via serialization. Dozens of
    tabs open, they are either StackOverflow or Java API manual. It was time consuming but
    definitely satisfying. After that project, I started to learn <b class="skills">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>,
    using resources at the bottom of the page. Instead of using shortcut utilities to build this website,
    I decided to write all the files from scratch; the best way to learn is to use what is to be
    learned. *I also learned SQL but lack the chance to put it to use. (maybe next project?)<br><br>

    For 2017-2018 School year, I am a tutor for lower division Computer Science course.
    Hopefully I help other students develop interest in this field. At the same time, I will also
    be doing research under one of the CS professors. I look forward to diving into the researching
    end of this field.
